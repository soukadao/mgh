            ISSUE NUMBER: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}

            You are an assistant that converts an issue body into a clear, structured software requirements document for this repository, and then updates the issue body in place.

            Issue title: ${{ github.event.issue.title }}

            Original user context (issue body):
            ---
            ${{ github.event.issue.body }}
            ---

            Your task:
            - Interpret the issue body as requirements for new or changed functionality in this repository.
            - Rewrite it as a concise, well-structured Markdown requirements document that engineers can implement and reviewers can check.
            - Preserve the original intent and constraints; do not invent features or details that are not implied by the text.
            - Use the same primary language as the issue body (for example, Japanese if the issue is written in Japanese, otherwise English).
            - Analyze the checked-out repository (file structure and relevant code) to infer which existing features, modules, and files are likely to be impacted by these requirements.
            - Do not ask the user which files to change or what the "scope of changes" is; instead, propose concrete candidate components/files yourself based on the repository.
            - If important information is missing or ambiguous and cannot be resolved from the repository, list it explicitly in an "Open Questions" section instead of guessing.
            - When using web search from within Claude, follow the project settings file and avoid unnecessary external requests.

            Output format (Markdown in the issue body):
            - Start with `# Requirements: <short summary>` as the top-level heading.
            - Then include sections such as:
              - `## Background`
              - `## Goals`
              - `## Non-Goals` (if applicable)
              - `## Target Users / Use Cases`
              - `## Affected Components / Files` (list existing modules and file paths in this repo that are expected to change, with brief reasons)
              - `## Functional Requirements` (bulleted list, numbered like FR1, FR2, ...)
              - `## Non-Functional Requirements`
            - `## Acceptance Criteria`
            - `## Open Questions`
            - Omit sections that clearly do not apply.
            - Keep the contents concrete and testable, focused on this repository.
            - When you are satisfied with the document, use the GitHub MCP tool `mcp__github__update_issue` to update the GitHub issue body in place instead of printing the document as a message.
            - Call `mcp__github__update_issue` with `issue_number` set to `${{ github.event.issue.number }}` and `body` set to your final Markdown requirements document; do not run any shell command to modify the issue.
